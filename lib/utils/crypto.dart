/// (the event's owner), so only whoever holds the private key can ever
/// decrypt them — that is what keeps them invisible to everyone else on the
/// relay, including the relay operator.
///
/// `dart_nostr` (the main Nostr SDK used elsewhere in Kairos) does not
/// implement NIP-44, so this wraps [Nip44] — see that file for the full
/// algorithm and why it's a direct implementation rather than a third-party
/// package. NIP-44 supersedes the older NIP-04 (ECDH + plain AES-256-CBC, no
/// padding, no message authentication), which the Nostr protocol now marks
/// deprecated; Kairos does not use NIP-04 anywhere.
///
/// This helper covers local-key sessions; Amber encryption/decryption is
/// delegated by [NostrService] and never exposes the private key to Kairos.
